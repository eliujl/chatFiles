# Q&A with files (txt, doc/docx, pdf, etc.): An Incomplete List of Useful links/resources

While developing projects related to chatting with files using AI tools (e.g., Open AI, Langchain, etc.), I made notes on valuable resources and links, but I soon became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new repositories, apps, and projects that are emerging every day. Keeping up with the pace proved impossible, so I have compiled an incomplete list below to help you get started.

- Common languages: Python (incl. ipynb), JS
- Common packages: OpenAI, Langchain, Pinecone, Chroma, ...
